# Matrix Trader 7.0 — Codex Context

## What This Is

**Matrix Trader 7.0** is a high-leverage crypto trading assistant for perpetual swap markets on MEXC.

It is a **local web application**: a Python Flask backend that serves a dark-themed HTML dashboard. You run it on your Mac with `python3 app.py` and open it in any browser — including on iPhone over local WiFi.

**It is not:**
- An execution bot yet — order placement is a staged future capability (P8–P12), currently disabled.
- A prediction engine (no ARIMA, no price forecasting)
- A SaaS product (local only for now)
- A multi-exchange aggregator (MEXC-first; other exchanges are context only)

**The core loop:**
1. User opens the dashboard
2. Hits "Scan All Perps" — fetches all 800+ MEXC futures tickers via public API
3. Sees a ranked signal table (LONG/SHORT, conviction score, entry/TP/SL)
4. Clicks a signal → requests an AI-generated trade brief (Codex API)
5. Uses the risk calculator to size the position
6. Executes manually on MEXC

## Project History

This is the 7th iteration. Versions 2–6 all failed. The MT6 codebase (`Matrix_Trader_6_0/`) was analyzed and the failure modes are documented. Do not repeat them:

| MT6 Mistake | MT7 Rule |
|---|---|
| Matrix chat bot as delivery mechanism | Web app only |
| ARIMA price forecasting | No forecasting. Signals only. |
| Two competing TUI implementations | One interface: the web dashboard |
| Coinglass API key committed in plaintext | All keys in `.env`, never committed |
| 17 planning markdown files instead of code | Ship before you plan |
| God class `EnhancedTradingBot` (900+ lines) | `app.py` stays flat until Phase 2 |
| Multi-exchange as primary venues | MEXC is primary. Others are context. |
| Jumped to automation without validated edge | Paper bot (P10) before micro-live (P12). Bot Readiness panel tracks progress. You decide when the data is sufficient. |

## File Structure

```
Matrix_Trader_7.0/
├── AGENTS.md              ← this file
├── README.md              ← for external users (write in Phase 4)
├── .gitignore
├── .env                   ← ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, MEXC_API_KEY (if needed)
├── requirements.txt
├── app.py                 ← entire Flask backend (keep flat, one file)
├── templates/
│   └── index.html         ← the full dashboard UI
├── static/

└── lib/                   ← ported MT6 components, cleaned up
    ├── indicators.py      ← RSI, EMA, VWAP, ATR
    ├── laddering.py       ← generate_ladders(price, atr, tiers, direction)
    └── mexc_stream.py     ← WebSocket wrapper
```

**Rules:**
- `app.py` is the backend. Everything lives here until Phase 2.
- `lib/` files are utilities only — no Flask routes, no API calls, pure functions.
- `templates/index.html` is the entire frontend. One file.
- No new files or folders without a specific reason.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11+ / Flask
- **Frontend:** Single HTML file, vanilla JS, dark theme
- **Data:** MEXC public contract API — no auth required for market data
- **AI layer:** Anthropic Codex API (for signal reports) — key in `.env`
- **WebSocket:** MEXC contract WS `wss://contract.mexc.com/edge`

---

## MEXC API Reference

All public, no auth needed:

```
Base URL: https://contract.mexc.com/api/v1

GET /contract/ticker                    — all perp tickers (800+ pairs)
GET /contract/detail                    — contract specs (leverage, fees)
GET /contract/kline/{symbol}            — OHLCV data
GET /contract/depth/{symbol}            — orderbook
GET /contract/funding_rate/{symbol}     — current funding rate

Intervals: Min1, Min5, Min15, Min30, Min60, Hour4, Hour8, Day1
```

Response wrapper: `{ "success": true, "data": [...] }`

## Signal Scoring Logic

Each ticker gets a score from 0–100 and a direction (LONG/SHORT):

| Input | Weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 24h price change | High | >5% strong momentum |
| Funding rate | High | Negative = short squeeze setup |
| Price vs fair price spread | Medium | Spread > 0 = longs paying |
| Orderbook imbalance | Medium | bid/ask depth ratio (10 levels) |
| Volume vs baseline | Low | relative, not absolute |
| Volatility regime (ATR%) | Modifier | scales leverage recommendation |

Conviction threshold: signals below 55 are filtered out by default.

## Key Functions to Know

### From lib/indicators.py
```python
vwap(df)           # Volume-weighted average price
ema(df, period)    # Exponential moving average
rsi(df, period=14) # Relative strength index
atr(df, period=14) # Average true range
```

### From lib/laddering.py
```python
generate_ladders(
    current_price,
    atr_value,
    tiers=3,
    direction="LONG",   # MT7 addition — MT6 only did long-side
    risk_reward=(1, 2)
) -> (entries, exits)
```

### From lib/mexc_stream.py
```python
MexcStreamAPI(on_kline, on_depth, on_funding)
.start(["kline.BTC_USDT.Min15", "depth.BTC_USDT"])
.stop()
```

## Rules of the Build

1. **Ship before you plan.** Running code before the next feature.
2. **One file, one job.** `app.py` stays flat. `lib/` files are pure functions.
3. **No features that don't serve the trader.** If it doesn't help make a better trade decision, it doesn't ship.
4. **The mobile test is non-negotiable.** Every UI change must work on iPhone Safari.
5. **No committed secrets.** `.env` only. `.env` is in `.gitignore` from day one.
6. **Error handling is a feature.** Every API call is wrapped in try/except. App never crashes.
7. **Signal quality over quantity.** 20 high-conviction signals beats 200 weak ones.
8. **The tool is for trading, not for looking at.** Aesthetics serve the signal, not the other way around.
9. **No databases for application state.** SQLite is acceptable for signal history logging and outcome tracking.

## Execution Safety Rules

Immutable. Cannot be softened by any future session prompt or task description.

1. Live trading is disabled by default. LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=false in .env is the master gate.
2. Paper simulation (P10) must run successfully before assisted live (P11) begins.
3. User confirmation required before every order in assisted mode — no silent placement.
4. Kill switch must be implemented and tested before P11 ships.
5. No automatic leverage escalation under any condition.
6. No averaging down.
7. No blind retry loops on failed order placement.
8. No execution on stale signal data (signal age > 5 minutes at order time).

## What's Ported from MT6

These are the only MT6 components worth keeping. Everything else was discarded.

| Component | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| RSI, EMA, VWAP, ATR | `Matrix_Trader_6_0/strategies/indicators.py` | Port to `lib/indicators.py` |
| Laddering logic | `Matrix_Trader_6_0/strategies/laddering.py` | Port to `lib/laddering.py`, add short-side |
| WebSocket wrapper | `Matrix_Trader_6_0/mexc_stream_api.py` | Port to `lib/mexc_stream.py` |
| OB imbalance calc | `Matrix_Trader_6_0/enhanced_trading_bot.py` (lines ~2966–2977) | Inline in `app.py` scoring |
| Volatility regime | `Matrix_Trader_6_0/market_extras.py` | Inline in `app.py` scoring |
| Concurrent fetch pattern | `Matrix_Trader_6_0/enhanced_trading_bot.py` (ThreadPoolExecutor) | Already in `app.py` |

## When Starting a New Session

1. Read this file (you just did)
2. Check which P3 tasks are unchecked above
3. Look at the current state of `app.py` and `templates/index.html`
4. Pick the next unchecked task and complete it fully before moving to the next
5. Update the checkbox in this file when a task is done

Do not start a new task until the previous one works end-to-end.
